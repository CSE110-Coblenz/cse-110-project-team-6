- Adopt a more structure review system (e.g., assign 1-2 consisten reviewers per pull request)
- Encourage smaller, more frequent pull requests for simplified reviewing and faster feedback
- Introduce optional pair-programming session, especially for complex tasks
	- Pair newer members with those whohave already implemented similar features
- Assign slightly fewer tasks per team member to ensure more thorough completion and testing
- Break down large tasks (e.g., minigame logic) into smaller subtasks with clear owners
- Standardize common operations (e.g., screen-switching, button behavior, controllers)
- Agree on naming conventions and file structures
- Start integrating a lightweight testing checklist for each feature
- Ensure each feature is tested by at least one person who did not contribute to it
- Finalize a clearer workflow for adding assets to avoid mismatches
